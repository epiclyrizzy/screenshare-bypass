Simple but good screenshare bypass

# what is this
Some youtube made a screenshare bypass but i made it better


# How to use

1. Make sure 1.bat and 2.bat are in the same directory as your exe file
2. Open 1.bat and type in the name of the exe with the extension so if i had a exe file called example.exe i would type in 1.bat "example.exe"
3. Open 2.bat (Don't delete filename)
